 * @brief Compile-time assertions that a struct of function pointers holds its members at
 *        consecutive slots and nothing else.
 * @author dstroy0 (Douglas Quigg) <dquigg123@gmail.com>
 * @date 2026-08-30
 *
 * @note This catches two mistakes, and neither shows up at a call site. Adding a member to the
 *       struct and leaving it out of the list moves every member below it off its slot. Padding
 *       appearing between two members does the same with no edit to the list at all.
 * @note The preprocessor has no loop. Each member count needs its own line. The family below runs
 *       out to twenty-four for that reason.
