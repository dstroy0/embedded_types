 * @date 2026-08-30
 *
 * @note This reaches <stdint.h> and not embed_types.h. The header under test declares no width of
 *       its own, and a suite that borrowed embed_types.h could fail for a defect in either one.
 * @note An attribute wrapper expands to nothing where its attribute is unavailable. That costs
 *       speed or a diagnostic, never correctness. A case for one of those is guarded on
 *       EMBED_HAS_ATTRIBUTE and calls TEST_IGNORE_MESSAGE on the other arm. Unity marks the case
 *       ignored, and a case that measured nothing does not count as a pass.
 * @note Unity's generator reads case names out of the source text and does not evaluate a
 *       preprocessor conditional, so every #if here sits inside a case body. A case defined inside
 *       one would be called by the runner on the arm where its definition is gone, and the suite
 *       would fail to link.
